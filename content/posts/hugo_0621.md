## 'Add to cart' button is gray
### 1. The button is gray
This is my first time using the Namecheap platform. I Signed in to the platform after registering. When i draft a domain name and try to add to my cart, i found the button is gray. As a beginner, i I panicked for a few seconds.Generally speaking, the gray button represents that it cannot be used.
