## 'Add to cart' button is gray
### 1. The button is gray
This is my first time using the Namecheap platform. I Signed in to the platform after registering. When i draft a domain name and try to add to my cart, i found the button is gray. As a beginner, i I panicked for a few seconds.Generally speaking, the gray button represents that it cannot be used.

### 2. 'Add to cart' button means the domain name still not be registered
The gray button named 'Add to cart' means the domain name still not be registered. If the domain name has been registered, the button is light gray and named "Make offer". Anyway, the gray buttons are active, it's the feature of Namecheap.
